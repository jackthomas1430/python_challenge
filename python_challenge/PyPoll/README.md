#PyPoll-Election Results

##Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze election data to help a small town with its vote counting process. The Python script, "pypoll_main.py" analyzes the dataset, "election_data.csv" and calculates the following values:
    
    -Total number of votes cast
    -Total number and percentage of votes each candidate received
    -The winner of the election 

The results are printed to the terminal and exported onto a txt file, "election_results.txt", which is located inside the "Resources" folder.
