# PyBank-Financial Analysis

##Description 

The purpose of this project is to examine the financial records of a company. The Python script, "pybank_main.py" analyzes the dataset, "budget_data.csv", which contains two columns: "Date" and "Profit Losses", and calculates the following values:
    
    -Total number of months included
    -The net total amount of "Profit/Losses"
    -The changes in "Profit/Losses" + the average change over the period 
    -The date and amount of the great increase in profits
    -The date and amount of the greatest decrease in profits

The results are printed to the terminal and exported onto the txt file, "financial_analysis.txt", which is located in the "Resources" folder. 

##File Structure
    
    -"python_challenge"(https://github.com/jackthomas1430/python_challenge.git): The main repo for both the PyBank and PyPoll challenges. The PyBank challenge folder contains the main Python script for the election results analysis, a "Resources" folder containing the dataset, and an "Anaylsis" folder with the txt file containing the results. 
    -"budget_data.csv": The dataset is located in the "Resources" folder. It contains two columns: "Date" and
